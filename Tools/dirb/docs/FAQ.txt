DIRB FAQ

Questions:

1) Can I use multiple wordfiles at a time?

2) I Know 3 directories exist, how can I scan them?

3) I'm newbie in security testing. Is DIRB an easy tool?

4) Can DIRB find or exploit vulnerabilities?

5) Can you include a description of each item found?

6) I'm desperate. I've used all the avaliable CGI scanners against a 
webserver and they don't found anything. DIRB can give me some hope?

7) Can DIRB be used like a classical CGI scanner?

8) What is the NOT_FOUND code?

9) What about a multi-thread version?

1) Can I use multiple wordfiles at a time?

YES, the wordfile parameter lets you specify multiple files separated by 
coma: ","

Example:

	$./dirb http://www.site.com/ wordlist1.txt,wordlist2.txt,wordlist3.txt


2) I know 3 directories exist, how can I scan them?

You have 2 options:

- Scan directly each directory. For example:

	$./dirb http://www.site.com/directory1/ wordlist.txt

	$./dirb http://www.site.com/directory2/ wordlist.txt

	$./dirb http://www.site.com/directory3/ wordlist.txt

- Include the name of the 3 directories in a text file (one directory by line)
and use it like a wordfile. DIRB will found the directories and scan into it. 
For example:

	$./dirb http://www.site.com/ wordlist.txt,dirnamefile.txt

Content of dirnamefile.txt:
----------------
directory1
directory2
directory3
----------------


3) I'm newbie in security testing. Is DIRB an easy tool?

NO. DIRB is a tool for automating the search of (normally hidden) web 
applications. But once you have found them, you need a good knowledge on 
security and penetration testing to get advantage of this information.


4) Can DIRB find or exploit vulnerabilities?

NO. DIRB look for web objects. To determine if they are vulnerable or not, 
you must use your own intelligence or other kind of tool.


5) Can you include a description of each item found?

NO. DIRB scan generic contents. I don't know what exists behind each one. 
Maybe some administrator use a file named "test.asp" as his main 
administration menu or simply is a "hello world" script...



6) I'm desperate. I've used all the avaliable CGI scanners against a 
webserver and they don't found anything. DIRB can give me some hope?

YES. DIRB can found something that classic CGI scanners can't found. Maybe 
it's your last chance.


7) Can DIRB be used like a classical CGI scanner?

YES. You only need to define a wordlist with common vulnerable CGI names, and 
feed this wordfile into DIRB. (The default dirb distribution comes
with a wordfile for this usage: "wordlists/vulns/cgis.txt")


8) What is the NOT_FOUND code?

NOT_FOUND is the response code that gives a webserver for not existant pages or
documents. DIRB use this code to locate only the correct existant pages and 
eliminate the rest. By default most webservers use code 404 (Page not found) 
but in some cases the NOT_FOUND code is not 404 and most CGI scanners will fail
in detecting existing pages.


9) What about a multi-thread version?

I have tested a simplified demo version of dirb running multiple threads and 
the speed gain was about 20-40%. This improvement is not significant and the 
complexity of the code does it (by now) not very useful.
